This project contains code examples created in Visual Studio Code for Computer Vision using C++ & OpenCV & Point Cloud Library (PCL) in ROS 2. These examples are created for the Computer Vision Subject of Robotics Software Engineering Degree at URJC.

This package is recommended to use with the [TIAGO](https://github.com/jmguerreroh/tiago_simulator) simulator.

# Installation 

You need to have previously installed ROS 2. Please follow this [guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html) if you don't have it.
```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

Clone the repository to your workspace:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/cv_ws/src
cd ~/cv_ws/src/
git clone https://github.com/jmguerreroh/tiago_simulator.git
cd ~/cv_ws/
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```

# Building project

```bash
colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF
``` 
# Run

Execute:
```bash
ros2 launch computer_vision cv.launch.py
```
If you want to use your own robot, in the launcher, change the topic names to match the robot topics.

## FAQs:

* /usr/bin/ld shows libraries conflicts between two versions:

Probably you have installed and built your own OpenCV version, rename your local folder:
```bash
mv /usr/local/lib/cmake/opencv4 /usr/local/lib/cmake/oldopencv4
```
